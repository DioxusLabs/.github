Welcome!

Dioxus Labs is a small team of open source enthusiasts on a mission to radically streamline app development.

Our goal is simplify the experience of building apps. To date, we've built:

- A UI library for Rust, similar to React / SolidJS
- A desktop renderer, similar to Electron
- A mobile renderer, similar to Flutter / React Native
- An HTML-over-websocket renderer, similar to Phoenix LiveView
- A backend server framework, similar to NextJS
- A Rust-based implementation of Flexbox, similar to Facebook's Yoga
- A (work-in-progress) HTML/CSS renderer in Rust
- A (work-in-progress) open source Firebase alternative 

Our [roadmap is public](https://pointy-quokka-0c3.notion.site/Dioxus-Labs-Public-Roadmap-771939f47d13423abe2a2195b5617555?pvs=4), and we welcome you to [read our story](https://dioxuslabs.com/blog/introducing-dioxus).
