Dioxus Labs is a small team of open source enthusiasts on a mission to radically simplify app development.

We want to support developers every step of the way: from designing UIs to deploying backend services. 

To date, we've built:

- [A UI library for Rust, similar to React / SolidJS](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus)
- [A web renderer, similar to React-dom](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.4/getting_started/wasm)
- [A desktop renderer, similar to Electron](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.4/getting_started/desktop)
- [A mobile renderer, similar to Flutter / React Native](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.4/getting_started/mobile)
- [An HTML-over-websocket renderer, similar to Phoenix LiveView](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.4/getting_started/liveview)
- [A backend server framework, similar to NextJS](https://dioxuslabs.com/learn/0.4/getting_started/fullstack)
- [A Rust-based implementation of Flexbox, similar to Facebook's Yoga](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy)
- [The fastest js-framework-benchmark implementation](https://github.com/Demonthos/sledgehammer_bindgen) 
- [A (work-in-progress) HTML/CSS renderer in Rust](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/blitz)
- [A (work-in-progress) open source Firebase alternative](https://dioxuslabs.com/deploy)
